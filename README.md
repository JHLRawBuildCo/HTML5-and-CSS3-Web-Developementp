# HTML5-and-CSS3-Web-Developementp
Coding Snippets from Traing form Cisco Network Academy for WebTechNetwork Presentaion "HTML Essentials".  This repository is for anyone who wants to review the basics of HTML5 and CSS3.  The code is available and adapted from code snippets found at "Cisco Network Academy" and my own understanding of basic coding tags and elements of HTML5 and CSS3 Styling tags and elements used in inline styling, internal styling, and external styling sheets.  As I progress through both "HTML Essential" and "CSS3 Essentials" courses offered by Cisco Network Academy, I will continue to contribute help[ful coding that will make your webpages structured and styled.  As I approach "Javascript Essentials I" and continue on to "Javascript Essentials 2,"  I will add code from those Javascipt training courses, that will help you make your basic static web pages more interactive.

As thses courses will have been completed, the "code snippets" will be used in self-made, adpted presentations made from Cisco Network Academy's guidance.  You arefree to use any "code snippets" that you may find in this repository.  If you have time, please contact me at jayhlindsey@webtechnetworkllc.com about how you used the "snippet" and how the snippet worked for you, when uyou incorporatedinto yur webpage or website.  

Thqnk you.  I appreciate your coopewration in this matter and hope you found the coding beneficial.

Sincerely,
